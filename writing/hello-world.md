# Hello, World

I've been thinking about how to write for a while now. Not the act of putting words down — that's straightforward enough — but *why* to write, and for whom.

## Why write at all?

There's a pattern I've noticed in myself. When reading technical books — DDIA, Database Internals, papers — I'll hit a concept that makes sense in the moment, but a week later I can't explain it to someone else. The understanding was shallow. It never stuck.

Writing forces depth. If I can't explain something clearly, I don't actually understand it. The act of writing becomes a test of comprehension.

## What to expect here

I'll be sharing:

- **Questions I ask while reading** — Often the most valuable part of learning isn't the answers, but the questions you learn to ask.
- **Mental models** — How I think about systems, trade-offs, and design decisions.
- **Things I build** — Not tutorials, but the *why* behind architectural choices.

The goal isn't to be comprehensive. It's to be clear.

## A note on style

I want this to feel like a conversation, not a lecture. I'm not an expert pretending to have all the answers. I'm someone working through ideas, and you're welcome to think alongside me.

If something resonates or you want to discuss, reach out. The best insights come from dialogue.

Let's see where this goes.
