# Arjun Garg - Personal Website Context

## Who I Am

**Arjun Garg** — 24 years old, engineering graduate (2023) from India.

**Current**: Founding Engineer at Proshort — building agent-first data infrastructure, multi-agent extraction pipelines, hybrid retrieval systems. Processing 150K sales calls monthly.

**Previous**: Data Engineer at ShareChat — India's largest regional social platform, 40M DAU, 15 languages. Built the "Golden Dataset" (unified fact table), data observability pipelines, feature sanity checks.

**Interests**: Distributed systems, database internals, systems engineering, the intersection of databases and AI/LLMs.

**Applying to**: MS in CS at top US universities (UCLA, CMU, UCB, UIUC) — but don't mention this explicitly on the site. The site should appeal to professors/admission committees without being explicit about applications.

## My Philosophy

**"2x knowledge for x/2 time"** — To live with better freedom, have twice the knowledge for the work you're executing. This lets you complete tasks in half the time and reclaim your freedom.

**Currently reading** to build this depth:
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppmann)
- Database Internals (Alex Petrov)
- CMU 15-445/645 course (Andy Pavlo)

**On learning**: Reading is easy; it's the tech jargon that creates fear. As a newbie, I ask a lot of questions — often because concepts build on assumed knowledge. I want to document these questions and learnings to help others in the same position.

**On expression**: Coming from a middle-class Indian background, I've noticed we often replace genuine understanding with textbook definitions to chase grades. I'm working to change this — to express ideas in my own words, not regurgitated definitions.

## Writing Goals

**Success metrics**:
1. Write like I'm talking to a person, not lecturing
2. Spark curiosity in readers
3. Quality content that hijacks attention like Instagram reels do — but for learning

**Tone**: Conversational, curious, thinking out loud. Not pretentious, not academic-speak. A scholar who's cool, not a nerd.

**Content**: Questions I ask while reading, mental models, aha moments, systems I build and why.

## Identity vs. Work

**Key principle**: My identity is separate from my professional affiliations.

- The landing page should be about **my interests, curiosity, and vision** — not what company I work for
- Companies (Proshort, ShareChat) are *where I apply my interests*, not *who I am*
- Work details belong on the Work page, not the landing page
- Mention companies casually if at all: "Right now that happens at Proshort" — not "I'm a Founding Engineer at Proshort building..."

**Why this matters**: I have my own direction irrespective of where I work. The site should reflect someone with independent intellectual interests who happens to work at places, not someone defined by their employer.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Aesthetic**: Academic/Paper — like someone who reads papers and builds systems, not someone who designs landing pages.

**Current design choices**:
- Serif typography (Source Serif 4) — scholarly, timeless
- Warm colors (#FFFEF8 background, #B45309 amber accent) — paper-like
- Narrow content width (600px) — like a book
- Minimal decoration — content over chrome
- No flashy animations — too playful for the vibe

**What to avoid**:
- "Frontend engineer" energy (gradients, cards, animations)
- Generic AI slop (Inter font, purple gradients)
- Explicit grad school applicant framing
- Pretentious academic language

**What to convey**:
- Deep technical thinking
- Someone who builds and ships
- Cool to be a scholar/developer — depth with personality
- Has more to life than just tech (subtle, not explicit)

---

## Technical Decisions

**Stack**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no frameworks
**Hosting**: GitHub Pages
**Architecture**: 
- Multi-page (index, work, writing)
- Single config file (`config.js`) for all personal data
- Markdown-based writing system (drop `.md` files in `writing/`, add to `posts.json`)

**Why these choices**:
- Ship fast, iterate fast
- No dependency hell
- Easy to maintain long-term
- Reflects systems mindset: minimal, intentional, no bloat

## When Building for Me

1. **Don't over-engineer** — Simple, functional, ships fast
2. **Academic aesthetic** — Serif, warm, paper-like, content-first
3. **Systems engineer vibe** — Not frontend, not designer
4. **Config-driven** — Changes should be easy, ideally in one file
5. **No explicit grad school mentions** — Professional presence that appeals to academics without begging
6. **Conversational tone** — In writing and copy, talk like a person
7. **Mobile-first** — Must work well on phones
8. **Extensible** — Easy to add posts, projects, sections later

## Voice Examples

**Good** (how I want to sound):
> "I think about how AI systems consume data — and how data systems can become smarter."

> "The goal isn't to be comprehensive. It's to be clear."

> "I'm not an expert pretending to have all the answers. I'm someone working through ideas."

**Bad** (avoid this):
> "I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation."

> "My research interests lie at the intersection of..."

> "I am seeking opportunities to contribute to..."
